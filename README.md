## Google Keep Clone with React

This project is a simple clone of Google Keep built using React and the Material UI library. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes (CRUD functionality). However, **please note that this version is purely a front-end application and does not persist data on a server.**

### Features

* Create notes with titles and content
* View a list of all created notes
* Update note content
* Delete notes
* Material UI design for a user-friendly experience

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-keep-clone-react.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd google-keep-clone-react
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will typically run the application on port 3000 (or the port specified in your package.json file). Access the app at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

2. **Note:** Since this is a front-end only application, any created notes will not be saved and will be lost when you refresh the page.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project! Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and create pull requests for review.

**Additional Information:**

To create a complete Google Keep clone with persisting data, you'll need to implement a back-end server using technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and a database like PostgreSQL. This will involve additional learning and configuration beyond the scope of this basic front-end implementation.
